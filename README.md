### AI-Agent Swarm

This README provides guidance on editing and using the Python script provided. The script includes functionalities for web scraping, summarization, and making Google searches using various APIs and models. 

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin editing or using this script, ensure that you have the following:

1. Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.
2. The required libraries installed. You can install them using the command:
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4 dotenv langchain autogen
   ```

#### Environment Setup

1. **Environment Variables**: 
   - The script requires two environment variables: `BROWSERLESS_API_KEY` and ``SERP_API_KEY``.
   - Create a `.env` file in the same directory as the script and add your API keys:
     ```
     BROWSERLESS_API_KEY=your_browserless_api_key
     SERP_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key
     ```

2. **Configuration Files**: 
   - Ensure that you have a configuration file named `OAI_CONFIG_LIST` in JSON format as required by the `config_list_from_json` function.

#### How to Edit

1. **Adding New Functions**:
   - You can add new functions by defining them in the script. Ensure that your functions are well-documented.

2. **Modifying Existing Functions**:
   - To change the functionality, edit the respective function. For instance, to change the way web scraping works, modify the `web_scraping` function.

3. **Updating Environment Variables and Configurations**:
   - You can update API keys and configurations by editing the `.env` file and the respective configuration JSON file.

4. **Integrating with Other APIs**:
   - If you wish to integrate other APIs, add the necessary request code in the function where you want to use it. 

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Consider adding more robust error handling to make the script more resilient against failures.

#### Running the Script

After making your changes, you can run the script using:

```bash
app.py
```

Ensure that your environment variables are set correctly and that all dependencies are installed.

#### Note

- Be cautious while editing the API keys and configurations to avoid breaking the script.
- Always test your changes in a controlled environment before deploying them.

This README aims to guide you in customizing and using the script effectively. Happy Coding!
