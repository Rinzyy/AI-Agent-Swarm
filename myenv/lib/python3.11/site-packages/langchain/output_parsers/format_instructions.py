PYDANTIC_FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS = """The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{schema}

XML_FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS = """The output should be formatted as a XML file.
1. Output should conform to the tags below. 
2. If tags are not given, make them on your own.
3. Remember to always open and close all the tags.

As an example, for the tags ["foo", "bar", "baz"]:
1. String "<foo>\n   <bar>\n      <baz></baz>\n   </bar>\n</foo>" is a well-formatted instance of the schema. 
2. String "<foo>\n   <bar>\n   </foo>" is a badly-formatted instance.
3. String "<foo>\n   <tag>\n   </tag>\n</foo>" is a badly-formatted instance.

Here are the output tags:
```

PANDAS_DATAFRAME_FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS = """The output should be formatted as a string as the operation, followed by a colon, followed by the column or row to be queried on, followed by optional array parameters.
1. The column names are limited to the possible columns below.
2. Arrays must either be a comma-seperated list of numbers formatted as [1,3,5], or it must be in range of numbers formatted as [0..4].
3. Remember that arrays are optional and not necessarily required.
4. If the column is not in the possible columns or the operation is not a valid Pandas DataFrame operation, return why it is invalid as a sentence starting with either "Invalid column" or "Invalid operation".

As an example, for the formats:
1. String "column:num_legs" is a well-formatted instance which gets the column num_legs, where num_legs is a possible column.
2. String "row:1" is a well-formatted instance which gets row 1.
3. String "column:num_legs[1,2]" is a well-formatted instance which gets the column num_legs for rows 1 and 2, where num_legs is a possible column.
4. String "row:1[num_legs]" is a well-formatted instance which gets row 1, but for just column num_legs, where num_legs is a possible column.
5. String "mean:num_legs[1..3]" is a well-formatted instance which takes the mean of num_legs from rows 1 to 3, where num_legs is a possible column and mean is a valid Pandas DataFrame operation.
6. String "do_something:num_legs" is a badly-formatted instance, where do_something is not a valid Pandas DataFrame operation.
7. String "mean:invalid_col" is a badly-formatted instance, where invalid_col is not a possible column.

Here are the possible columns:
```
{columns}
